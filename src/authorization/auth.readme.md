# Authorization
- Authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is able to do
- example 
   - user can have create, edit, and delete post accesss
   - admin have read post access

- Authorization is orthogonal and independent from authentication.
- However, authorization requires an authentication mechanism

# Basic RBAC implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges
